Generates two files: `amast.h` and `amast.c`.

`amast.h` is generated by combining all `.h` files listed in `files.txt.in`.

`amast.c` is generated by combining all `.c` files listed in `files.txt.in`.

Each file pasted into `amast.h` and `amast.c` is prepended with a comment
specifying the full path name of the file in the amast repository.

`amast.c` file has `#include "amast.h"` at the beginning.
All other user includes of the form `#include "<file name>" are removed from
`amast.c` file.

All unit test files included into `amast.c` are wrapped into

```C
    #ifdef AMAST_UNIT_TESTS
    #endif /* AMAST_UNIT_TESTS */
```

Therefore, to run unit tests in `amast.c` file compile it with `AMAST_UNIT_TESTS`.
