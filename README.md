## How To Compile For Amast Development
<a name="how-to-compile"></a>

On Linux or WSL:

Install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation).
Run `pixi run all`.

## How To Use The Latest Amast Release
<a name="how-to-use"></a>

Include

- `amast.h`
- `amast_config.h`
- `amast.c`
- `amast_preemptive.c` or `amast_cooperative.c`

from the latest release to your project.

If you want to use Amast features that require porting, then also add the following
port to you project:

- `amast_posix.c`
- `amast_libuv.c`

If you want to run Amast unit tests, then also include `amast_test.h` and `amast_test.c`.

`Makefile` is available for optional use. Run `make test` to run the unit tests.

## Features, Bugs, etc.

The project uses "Discussions" instead of "Issues".

"Discussions" tab has different discussion groups for "Features" and "Bugs".

For making sure issues are addressed, both me and the community can better evaluate which issues and features are high priority because they can be "upvoted".
