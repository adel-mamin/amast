Welcome to Amast
================

Welcome to Amast's documentation. Amast is a lightweight C application toolkit.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
complex applications.

Get started with :doc:`installation`
and then get an overview with the :doc:`quickstart`. There is also a
more detailed :doc:`tutorial/index` that shows how to create a small but
complete application with Amast. Common patterns are described in the
:doc:`patterns/index` section. The rest of the docs describe each
component of Amast in detail, with a full reference in the :doc:`api`
section.

User's Guide
