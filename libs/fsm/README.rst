Introduction
============

This FSM (Finite State Machine) library provides a lightweight API for defining,
creating, and managing state machines in C. The library includes support for
state transitions, entry/exit actions, and event handling.
It also provides a debugging mechanism through the "spy" callback,
allowing users to observe events as they pass through the state machine.
This library is ideal for applications that require structured and manageable
state control in an embedded system or other C-based environments.

The FSM is a combination of one or more state-handler functions of
type **am_fsm_state**.

Example FSM
============

Below is an example of a simple FSM with three states
(`Idle`, `Processing`, and `Completed`) and basic transitions:

.. uml::

    @startuml

    left to right direction

    [*] --> Idle

    state Idle #LightBlue
    state Processing #LightBlue
    state Completed #LightBlue

    Idle --> Processing : Start
    Processing --> Completed : Complete
    Completed --> Idle : Reset

    @enduml

This FSM transitions from `Idle` to `Processing` upon receiving a `Start` event,
completes the processing, and then returns to `Idle` with a `Reset` event.

Event Handling
==============

Events in this FSM are defined by the **struct am_event** structure,
with device IDs starting from **AM_EVT_USER**.

Each event is handled in a state handler function that receives the event and
processes it accordingly.

FSM reserved events are defined as follows:

- **AM_EVT_FSM_ENTRY**: Indicates the entry into a state. Entry actions are executed here.
- **AM_EVT_FSM_EXIT**: Indicates the exit from a state. Exit actions are executed here.

The **am_fsm_dispatch()** function is used to send events to the FSM.

State Transition
================

The library supports two main types of state transitions:

1. Standard Transition (**AM_FSM_TRAN()**):
   Moves directly from the current state to the new state.
2. Redispatch Transition (**AM_FSM_TRAN_REDISPATCH()**):
   Transitions to a new state and redispatches the event for further processing.

Both type of state transitions are used within state handlers to initiate
a transition, updating the FSM's state and returning control to the dispatcher.

If state handler function returns **AM_FSM_TRAN_REDISPATCH(target_state)**,
then the transition is executed first and then the same event is
dispatched to the new current state. This is a convenience feature,
that allows FSM to handle the event in the state that expects it.

FSM states cannot initiate state transitions when processing entry and exit
events.

Initial State
=============

The initial state of the FSM is provided during the FSMâ€™s construction
using the **am_fsm_ctor()** function.

This state is set to handle any initial setup required by the FSM and
ensures that the FSM begins with a predictable configuration.

The function **am_fsm_init()** initiates the FSM with an optional initial event.

Example:

.. code:: c

    struct am_fsm my_fsm;
    am_fsm_ctor(&my_fsm, initial_state);
    am_fsm_init(&my_fsm, NULL); /* initiates with no event */

The initial state must always return **AM_FSM_TRAN(new_state)** macro
to proceed to the appropriate active state.

FSM Coding Rules
================

1. FSM states must be represented by event handlers of type **am_fsm_state_fn**.
2. The name of the first argument of all user event handler functions
   must be **me**.
3. For convenience instead of using **struct am_fsm *me** the first argument
   can point to a user structure. In this case the user structure
   must have **struct am_fsm** instance as its first field.
   For example, the first argument can be **struct foo *me**, where
   **struct foo** is defined like this:

.. code-block:: C

   struct foo {
       struct am_fsm fsm;
       ...
   };

4. Each user event handler should be implemented as a switch-case of handled
   events.
5. Avoid placing any code with side effects outside of the switch-case of
   event handlers.
6. Processing of **AM_EVT_FSM_ENTRY** and **AM_EVT_FSM_EXIT** events should
   not trigger state transitions. It means that user event handlers should
   not return **AM_FSM_TRAN()** or **AM_FSM_TRAN_REDISPATCH()** for
   these events.

FSM Initialization
==================

FSM initialization is divided into the following two steps for increased
flexibility and better control of the initialization timeline:

1. the state machine constructor (**am_fsm_ctor()**)
2. the initial transition (**am_fsm_init()**).

Transition To History
=====================

Transition to history is a useful technique that is convenient to apply in
certain use cases. It does not require to use any dedicated FSM API.

Given the following three states:

.. uml::

    @startuml

    [*] --> A

    state A #LightBlue {
        C --> [H] : E4
    }
    state B #LightBlue {
        C --> [H] : E4
    }
    state C #LightBlue

    A --> C : E1
    A --> B : E2
    B --> C : E3

    @enduml

the transition to history technique can be
demonstrated as follows. Assume that transition to the state *C* may
happen from state *A* or state *B*. As an example, assume the the FSM
is in the state *A*.

The user code stores the current state in a local variable of type
**am_fsm_state_fn**. This is done with:

.. code-block:: C

   struct foo {
   struct am_fsm fsm;
       ...
       am_fsm_state_fn history;
       ...
   };
   ...
   static enum am_fsm_rc A(struct foo *me, const struct event *event) {
       switch (event->id) {
       case AM_EVT_FSM_ENTRY:
           me->history = am_fsm_state(&me->fsm);
           return AM_FSM_HANDLED();
       ...
       }
       return AM_FSM_HANDLED();
   }

Then the transition to the state *C* happens, which is then followed by a request
to transition back to the previous state. Since the previous state is captured
in **me->history** it can be done by doing this:

.. code-block:: C

   static enum am_fsm_rc C(struct foo *me, const struct event *event) {
       switch (event->id) {
       case FSM_EVT_E4:
           return AM_FSM_TRAN(me->history);
       ...
       }
       return AM_FSM_HANDLED();
   }

As you can see the state *C* does not need to specify the previous
state explicitly - it simply uses whatever state was previously stored in
**me->history** as the target state of the transition.

So, this is essentially all about it.

Another example of the usage of the transition to history technique can be seen
in **tests/history.c** unit test.
